The site design is a modified version of Slate by [Jason Costello](http://twitter.com/jsncostello).

Some of the "social media buttons" in the header of this page are from the [Dark Social Icons set](http://www.pixeden.com/social-icons/dark-social-icons-set) by [Pixeden](http://www.pixeden.com).

The following buttons were not from that pack, but were created by [Nicola Bortignon](http://www.nicolabortignon.com/) to match the set:

* Email
* GitHub
* StackOverflow

Unless otherwise indicated, everything else on this site (including images, code, and content) is owned by [Andreas Renberg](mailto:contact@iqandreas.com) and may not be used or redistributed without written permission.
