The languages I have been required to dabble in have varied from ActionScript to Java, from Ruby to Python, from PHP to JavaScript. Okay, so maybe the languages don't vary _that_ much. They are nearly all object oriented, and only tend to vary slightly in syntax and libraries; it's not like I have ever worked on a project in [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29).

Nonetheless, nearly every _personal_ project I work on is open source, and usually finds its way onto GitHub:

{% include flink site="github.com" title="IQAndreas on GitHub" url="https://github.com/IQAndreas/" %}

Some recent or significant projects of mine include:

{% include lists/data/repositories.html %}
