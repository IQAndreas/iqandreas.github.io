title: 'MineCraft - Adjustable Anaglyph Patch'
name: adjustable-anaglyph
---
<p>This MineCraft patch allows you to adjust the anaglyph settings.</p>

<p><em>NEW: This patch is also available for snapshot 12w26a</em>, and will work on any multiplayer server by only modding the client (see &ldquo;Download&rdquo; section below for details).</p>

<p>You can change the anaglyph mode to one of these colors:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>RED/CYAN (Default)</em></li>
<li><em>Trioscopic (GREEN/MAGENTA)</em></li>
<li><em>ColorCode 3D (AMBER/DARK BLUE)</em></li>
<li><em>RED/GREEN</em></li>
<li><em>RED/BLUE</em></li>
</ul>


<p>For tweaking the anaglyph strength, there are two sliders available, both adjust different properties. Test around and see what works for you.</p>

<p>The patch is still in Beta, so any input, feedback, and bug reports are greatly appreciated.</p>

<h3>This is a Patch, not a Mod</h3>




<p><strong>It will not affect your world save</strong><br/>
    No new items or blocks will be added to your maps. This means the mod can be uninstalled, reinstalled, or MineCraft upgraded (causing the patch to automatically uninstall) without any issues.</p>




<p><strong>It does not require any mod APIs</strong><br/>
    This patch modifies base classes in the MineCraft source code. No mod APIs are required to use it, nor can it be modified to use a mod API rather than modifying base classes (hooks just won&#8217;t cut it!).</p>
