<p>The following are installable mods and patches for the award-winning sandbox game <a href="http://www.minecraft.net/">MineCraft</a>.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise indicated, all of the mods and patches are 100% compatible with each other.</p>

<h3>Patches</h3>

<p>MineCraft is great, but it&rsquo;s not perfect. Pop these classes into your JAR to fix some common annoyances with MineCraft. Some of these fixes I genuinely feel should be in the vanilla game, others are made by request (even if I may not agree that they should be in the game for balance or other reasons). Pick and choose for your self which ones you like.</p>

<p>Patches are slightly different from mods. While mods may add new items or change game mechanics and objectives, a patch is meant to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; or &ldquo;suppliment&rdquo; MineCraft (but it&rsquo;s installed to the JAR just like standard &ldquo;mods&rdquo;).</p>

<p><strong>It will not affect your world save</strong><br/>
    No new items or blocks will be added to your maps. This means the mod can be uninstalled, reinstalled, or MineCraft upgraded (causing the patch to automatically uninstall) without any issues.</p>




<p><strong>It does not require any mod APIs</strong><br/>
    This patch modifies base classes in the MineCraft source code. No mod APIs are required to use it, nor can it be modified to use a mod API rather than modifying base classes (hooks just won&#8217;t cut it!).</p>


<p><strong>Available patches</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="/minecraft/no-more-void-fog">No More Void Fog!</a></strong><br/>
Is void fog hiding your underground structures? This patch will add an option in the &#8220;Video Settings&#8221; to disable or reduce void fog.</p>
