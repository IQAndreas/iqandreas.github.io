name: craftable-double-slabs
---
<p>Planning to build a massive structure out of double half-slab blocks? Tired of placing twice as many blocks to make the building?</p>

<p>With this patch, you can craft double half-slab blocks and use them to build with.</p>

<ul>
<li>Double smoothstone slab blocks are made with two smoothstone slabs</li>
<li>Fireproof double wood slab blocks are made with two wood slabs</li>
</ul>


<p>Made too many half-slabs? You can also convert some half-slabs back into full blocks</p>

<ul>
<li>Two cobblestone slabs become one cobblestone block</li>
<li>Two stone brick slabs become one stone brick block</li>
<li>Two brick slabs become one brick block</li>
</ul>


<h3>This is a Patch, not a Mod</h3>




<p><strong>It will not affect your world save</strong><br/>
    No new items or blocks will be added to your maps. This means the mod can be uninstalled, reinstalled, or MineCraft upgraded (causing the patch to automatically uninstall) without any issues.</p>




<p><strong>It does not require any mod APIs</strong><br/>
    This patch modifies base classes in the MineCraft source code. No mod APIs are required to use it, nor can it be modified to use a mod API rather than modifying base classes (hooks just won&#8217;t cut it!).</p>
