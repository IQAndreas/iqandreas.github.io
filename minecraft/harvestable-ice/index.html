title: 'MineCraft - Harvestable Ice Blocks'
name: harvestable-ice
---
<p>This MineCraft patch allows you to once again harvest ice blocks. Ever wanted to build a castle out of ice? Now you can!</p>

<ul>
<li>Ice blocks can be harvested with the Silk Touch enchantment</li>
<li>Ice blocks will randomly start to melt in the Nether</li>
<li>If an ice block melts or is broken in the Nether, it will fizzle and disappear instead of turning to water (similar to emptying a water bucket in the Nether)</li>
</ul>


<h3>This is a Patch, not a Mod</h3>




<p><strong>It will not affect your world save</strong><br/>
    No new items or blocks will be added to your maps. This means the mod can be uninstalled, reinstalled, or MineCraft upgraded (causing the patch to automatically uninstall) without any issues.</p>




<p><strong>It does not require any mod APIs</strong><br/>
    This patch modifies base classes in the MineCraft source code. No mod APIs are required to use it, nor can it be modified to use a mod API rather than modifying base classes (hooks just won&#8217;t cut it!).</p>
