<h3>This is a Patch, not a Mod</h3>




<p><strong>It will not affect your world save</strong><br/>
    No new items or blocks will be added to your maps. This means the mod can be uninstalled, reinstalled, or MineCraft upgraded (causing the patch to automatically uninstall) without any issues.</p>




<p><strong>It does not require any mod APIs</strong><br/>
    This patch modifies base classes in the MineCraft source code. No mod APIs are required to use it, nor can it be modified to use a mod API rather than modifying base classes (hooks just won&#8217;t cut it!).</p>


<h3>Download</h3>

<p>As per request, there are two versions of this mod.</p>

<p><strong>No more Ghast Griefing!</strong>
Fireballs from Ghasts no longer destroy blocks when they explode. They can still hurt you or other entities, and will still set flame to nearby flammable blocks (so as usual, don&rsquo;t build wood houses in the Nether!).
