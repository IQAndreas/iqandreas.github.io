title: 'MineCraft - Leaves Fixes Patch'
name: leaves-fixes
---
<p>Patch that makes leaves more appealing to break yourself, rather than waiting for them to decay naturally.</p>

<ul>
<li>Axes are more effective against leaf blocks</li>
<li>Axes no longer take double damage against leaves</li>
<li>The &ldquo;fortune&rdquo; enchantment increases the odds of a leaf block dropping saplings and apples</li>
<li>Destroying leaf blocks manually (rather than waiting for them to decay) doubles the odds of dropping saplings and apples</li>
<li>Destroying leaf blocks manually has a low chance of also dropping sticks</li>
<li>Plus a bonus easter egg involving gold axes&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<h3>This is a Patch, not a Mod</h3>




<p><strong>It will not affect your world save</strong><br/>
    No new items or blocks will be added to your maps. This means the mod can be uninstalled, reinstalled, or MineCraft upgraded (causing the patch to automatically uninstall) without any issues.</p>




<p><strong>It does not require any mod APIs</strong><br/>
    This patch modifies base classes in the MineCraft source code. No mod APIs are required to use it, nor can it be modified to use a mod API rather than modifying base classes (hooks just won&#8217;t cut it!).</p>
