<p>Cauldrons now work as magical 1x1 infinite water source blocks.</p>

<p>Fill an empty cauldron with water from a bucket. Once it is filled:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can fill empty buckets with water from the cauldron</li>
<li>You can fill empty bottles with water from the cauldron</li>
<li>You can empty buckets of water into the cauldron, giving you an empty bucket</li>
</ul>


<p>The cauldron will never run out of water.</p>

<h3>This is a Patch, not a Mod</h3>




<p><strong>It will not affect your world save</strong><br/>
    No new items or blocks will be added to your maps. This means the mod can be uninstalled, reinstalled, or MineCraft upgraded (causing the patch to automatically uninstall) without any issues.</p>




<p><strong>It does not require any mod APIs</strong><br/>
    This patch modifies base classes in the MineCraft source code. No mod APIs are required to use it, nor can it be modified to use a mod API rather than modifying base classes (hooks just won&#8217;t cut it!).</p>
